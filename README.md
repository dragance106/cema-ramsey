The present project implements cross-entropy method for constructing critical graphs for small multicolor Ramsey numbers. It builds upon our previous implementation available at [github.com/dragance106/cema-for-graphs](https://github.com/dragance106/cema-for-graphs). It accompanies the paper "Reinforcement learning for graph theory, II. Small Ramsey numbers" by M. Ghebleh, S. Al-Yakoob, A. Kanso and D. StevanoviÄ‡, where four new lower bounds on small Ramsey numbers obtained by this project are presented.
