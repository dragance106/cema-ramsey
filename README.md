# Cross-entropy method for small Ramsey numbers

The present project implements cross-entropy method for constructing critical edge-colorings for small multicolor Ramsey numbers. It builds upon our previous implementation available at [github.com/dragance106/cema-for-graphs](https://github.com/dragance106/cema-for-graphs).

This research was supported by the Science Fund of the Republic of Serbia, #6767, Lazy walk counts and spectral radius of graphs - LZWK.
